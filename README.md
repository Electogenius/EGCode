# EGCode/EGC (can also be pronounced "egg-sea")
A badly implemented programming language that is dangerously loosely typed.
![Logo](logo.JPG)
EGCode compiles to JavaScript.
No data types (kind of)

Because who needs "" and '', am I right

**version: 0.9.6**

```EGCode
log(hello world)

var x(10)
log([$x + 15])
^logs 25
this is a comment, yep
```
