# EGCode/EGC (can also be pronounced "egg-sea")
A badly implemented programming language that is dangerously loosely typed.

EGCode compiles to JavaScript.

No data types (kind of)

Because who needs "" and '', am I right

**version: 0.8.8**

```EGCode
print(hello world)
var x(10)
print([$x + 15])
 ^ supposed to log 25 (doesn't work yet but coming soon)
